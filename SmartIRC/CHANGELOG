v0.4.0
------
* phpSmartIRCclass.inc.php:
 - fixed serious socket bug
   The buffer of the socket got full because only 512 bytes were read at once,
   which caused losing some IRC messages that are comming fast like the MOTD.
   Now it will read 10240 bytes at once, and doesn't loose any IRC message.
 - fixed sendbuffer
   The sendbuffer will only be sent, when the class is fully connected and
   registered on the IRC network. Before if a nickname collision happened,
   all sent IRC commands from the buffer were ignored by the IRC server.
 - fixed socket status
   Socket handling is now compatible with PHP 4.3 dev.
 - fixed $_nick
   When the nickname got changed because of nickname is already in use,
   $_nick  will be updated. (thanks for the hint to Andreas Streichardt).
 - fixed actionhandler ids (unregister caused that the other ids were  changed).
 - fixed TYPE_TOPIC to the right bitoperator value.
 - added a reference to the IRC class in actionhandler callbacks
   WARNING: all user writtin methods have to be changed!!
   method( &$data ) _has to be changed_ to method( &$irc, &$data )
   If you don't change those, your IRC scripts will _not_ work anymore!
 - changed internal methodnames to _methodname
 - changed sendbuffer
   Now it uses configurable senddelay, instead of static 2 messages  
   per second (send flood protection).
 - changed TYPEs
   All TYPE_* are now bitwise constants, register_actionhandler() can now
   react to more than one message type.
 - added TYPE_ACTION for those common /me messages.
 - added timeevents   Added method register_timehandler()
   unregister_timeid() and   reordertimehandler(). Those timehandler
   can be used to call methods in specified intervalls, e.g. for
   timeevents. Added needed class CphpSmartIRCclass_timehandler.
 - moved all IRC related defines to defines.inc.php.
 - changed if() elseif() structures where possible to switch() for
   clearer/faster code.
 - added more debug messages for actionhandler.

   unregister methods was called.
