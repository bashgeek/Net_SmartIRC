todo:

Move logger, messagehandler, and irccommands out and bring them in with encapsulation.
  Use __call() to redirect old method calls so as to not break BC.
	log()
	setLogDestination()
	setLogFile()
**API** then we have several structs, basically. is that the best way to do it?
	(data, actionhandler, timehandler, channel, user, channeluser<-user, ircuser<-user)
	Privately used only: action/time

Usersyncing not fully implemented! *_ircuser class is never used. Neither is $_users.
