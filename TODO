todo:

Move logger out to its own class and bring it in with inheritance, like the rest.
  It's not the best way but it won't break BC.
	log()
	setLogDestination()
	setLogFile()
**API** then we have several structs, basically. is that the best way to do it?
	(data, actionhandler, timehandler, channel, user, channeluser<-user, ircuser<-user)
	Privately used only: action/time,

Usersyncing not fully implemented! *_ircuser class is never used. Neither is $_users.
