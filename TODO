todo:

**API** replycodes are in defines.php and public vars in base class??
**API** public $channel, $user? make private + getters/setters... + __get/__set for BC?
**API** move logger out to its own class and pass in as a dependency w/ class consts
	log()
	setLogDestination()
	setLogFile()
**API** change most defines to class constants
**API** why would we need connect() and login() to be called separately?
**API** loadModule() should be able to take any class name
	- also it needs to be pulling in module classes that have the proper iface
**API** registerTimeHandler should probably convert times from s to ms internally
**API** then we have several structs, basically. is that the best way to do it?
	(data, actionhandler, timehandler, channel, user, channeluser<-user, ircuser<-user)
**API** connect and login need to be one method. and return success or failure.
**API** Net_SmartIRC_data is kind of a pointless class. could be an array,
	but changing it would break BC.
**API** Instead of loadModule() loading files and stuff, make it just load classes
	and let the user determine how to bring them into PHP. Then classes can be
	named whatever. But they'll need to implement an interface which we need to make.
